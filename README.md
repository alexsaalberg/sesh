# sesh

Sesh (SpacE SHell) is an experimental tui file browser.

It's written in Go and uses [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell).

The goal of sesh is to make it faster to do common things on the terminal (such as navigating to a folder or moving files).

This should be possible by using an interface built around limited finger movement and using past usage statistics to give frequent actions priority.
